if we want to protect the route means only allow to authenticate person to view the page
than we have 2 way to achieve this.

1) we can use middelware
    example=>
        Route::get(uri, controller)->middleware("auth");
2) we can use constructor in the controller class so in that case
   it will apply(protect) every route or every method of that respective controller class
   example=>
        public function __construct() {
            $this->middleware("auth");
        }

So based on the requirement you can choose any way to protect the routes.
