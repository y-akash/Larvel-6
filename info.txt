To see all the routes used in an application
    php artisan route:list

Auth::routes(); this will generate generate a lot of routes for us behind the scenes to do with authentication
so if we want to disable any routes or we dont want any routes so we can do that
by providing an array inside routes.
example=>
    Auth::routes([
        "register" => false
    ]);
    so from the above it will disable the register route.
