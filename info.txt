first we have added @csrf inside the form of create.blade.php
bcoz if we dont give this when we submit the form it will give 419 session expired error

419 session expire
    This is built in laravel error to help to protect from cross site request forgery.
    or (from google) 419 Page Expired error message in Laravel comes up because somewhere your csrf token verification fails which means the App\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken::class middleware is already turned on.
    so to avoid this error we have to add @csrf blade directive inside form.

If we want to save record in DB
    we creat an instance of Pizza Model bcoz Pizza Model represents the pizza table in DB
    so if we create an instance so it will be programmatic version of a record in that table.
    example=>
    in DB we have a table name students
    so that we create a class Name Student which extends Model class.
    so when we create an instance of Student class it will represent the programmatic table of DB.
    & or it will know ki kansa table hai and.


session data
    return redirect("/")->with("mssg", "Thanks for your order"); // ->("key", "value")
