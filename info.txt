Laravel comes with a authentication system so we just need to figure out how to use it

we have already migration of User table file and User Model file these are already present when we created a laravel project

so we just need to make frontend where it ask for register, login etc.
and we can make those frontend from scratch but there is one another easier way
called UI package which has already built in.

so it's on us what we want to use built in or build from scratch, in this we gonna use built in.

1) install UI package using composer
    composer require laravel/ui
2) after installation we can use this UI package to boilerplate some front-end for us so we can use react, veu or any other front-end thing so we are using veu
3) php artisan ui vue --auth    // this gonna do boilerplate a lot of different  things for us.
4) after this we have to run some more commands
    npm install
    npm run dev
5) after running all the above commands we get some boilerpate file which will present inside resources/views/auth folder.
   it also add some stuff to our rout files i.e. web.php
   for example=>
   Auth::routes();
        the above line generate a lod of routes for us behind the scenes to do with authentication
