we can't store an array as a data type in sql
but what we can store as a json string which can represent an array

datatype will be *longtext*
example
    ["garlic", "olives"]    => this will be stored as a string
    or you can imagine as we do stringify in javascript

in laravel we cant pass array so we have to change it json so
in Model we can do that by using $casts
example=>
    protected $casts = ["columnName" => "DataType"];
