<a href="/pizzas" class="back"> Back to all pizzas </a>
in above anchor tag we have given a link to /pizzas so if requirement comes ki route change karna hai and
it new route becomes /order/pizzas than if that old route is present on multiple places
so it will be very difficult to change on every place
so we can do this by chaining ->name("") to route.
example=>
    Route::get("/pizzas/create", [PizzaController::class, "create"])->name("giveName");
    so the above "giveName" point to "/pizzas/create"
    now we can use that "giveName" to every place when new requirement comes so we just need to change only at Route::get("thisPlaceOnly")
    <a href="{{route("giveName")}}" class="back"> Back to all pizzas </a>


{{route("giveName", "anoterValue")}} we can pass argument also in route
 it will become => giveName/anotherValue
