what is migration?
    it allow us to programmatically define the structure of a table in our database from our code.
    and for that we have to create migration file.
    or
    in simple word, we can manually create table in the db but if we want to create programmatically than
    we can create migration file & when we run those file we will get the table in the db.

in migration file there will be two method present up() & down()
    up() => it is responsible for creating & defining the structure of table.
    down()  => it is responsible droping the table or it is opposite of up() method.

command to create a migration file or we can manually create the file
    php artisan make:migration fileName;

command to run migration
    php artisan migrate
    so the above command will go in each migration file and run up method

command to rollback migration
    php artisan migrate:rollback
    if we have migrated 3 file and after that we created one new file and migrate that file also.
    after this if we try to rollback than it will rollback the last migrated one new file and the
    previous 3 migrated file will remain as it is it will not rollback.
    so the above command will only rollback the latest migration.
