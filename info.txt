it's something similar to JPA repository where we dont write sql query we just write method and based on method we get the value
similarly laravel provides predefined method which can be use to interact with db without writing sql quries.

What is eloquent models?
    Laravel includes Eloquent, an object-relational mapper (ORM) that makes it enjoyable to interact with your database.
    ... In addition to retrieving records from the database table,
    Eloquent models allow you to insert, update, and delete records from the table as well.

what is model
    model in programming is normally a class or an object blueprint that represents a certain type of data.
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    now in laravel we can create an eloquent model
    to represent that type of data, a pizza model and then if we want to interact with that type
    of data in the DB we will use that model to do.
    so now under the hood eloquent uses sql to interact with teh DB but it also wraps all of that in an extra layer and
    it provide us with a bunch of easy to use methods on the model.

command to make model
    php artisan make:model ModelName (First letter should be capital its a convention)
    example=> php artisan make:model Pizza
        it will create a file with name Pizza.php & it will have class name Pizza
        larvel detect the table name by pluralizing the class name like
        Here class name is Pizza so it will detect or connect to pizzas table or we can tell the name of table
        so kis table ka model bana rahe (kis table se connect karna hai model ko) hai for that we have to write inside the class
        protected $table = "tableName";
